## **Project Description:**  
This project uses the MERN stack and was created to teach my friends the basics of programming.  
Specifically, the dependencies we use include Mongo, express, react, node, axios, dotenv, concurrently, react-router-dom, mongoose, and perhaps in the future redux.  
The todolist is pretty generic.  It includes a timer and what you would expect of a todolist.  I added the capability to create different lists and am planning to add the ability to have multiple users (hashed through bcrypt).
